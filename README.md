- Solana Command Line Tools (CLI) - Refer to the Solana documentation [here](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) for installation.

### Building the Smart Contract

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solana-nft-marketplace.git
cd solana-nft-marketplace


### Build the smart contract using Cargo (Rust's package manager).
bash
Copy code
cargo build-bpf
Usage
The compiled program, once built, generates a .so file (shared object file) that represents the smart contract bytecode. This file can be deployed on the Solana blockchain.

To deploy and interact with this smart contract, refer to Solana's developer documentation on deploying programs to the Solana network.
